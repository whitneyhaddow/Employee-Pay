Employee-Pay
============

A basic program to calculate weekly pay for an employee

First version (lab 1) is the first application I ever created. It simply calculates employee pay for 1 week based on hours worked and pay rate per hour. Overtime is "time and a half" and full time hours are equivalent to 37.5 hrs. No validation is included.

Second version (Lab 3) is an improvement on this simple application. Data validation was included and the calculate procedure was moved to it's own method. Clearing of text boxes and labels improved (automated).
